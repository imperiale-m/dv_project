# Data Visualization Project
Our Data Visualization project focuses on life expectancy in the European Union. In this project, we explore the differences in life expectancy between different countries and the impact of social and economic factors.<br /> Life expectancy is a statistical measure that estimates the average amount of time a person is likely to live based on current mortality rates. It's calculated by analyzing the death rates of different age groups within a population and is expressed as the number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.<br /> The data has been sourced from the statistical office of the European Union (EUROSTAT) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
